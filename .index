summary: Robust library file locator
created: '2009-11-24'
description: Finder is a general purpose file finder for Ruby. Finder can search RubyGems,
  Roll libraries and Ruby's standard $LOAD_PATH and system data directory for the
  active or the most current library files. It is especially useful for implementing
  library-based plugin systems.
